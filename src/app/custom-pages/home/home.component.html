<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
  I'm Chris. I'm a web developer in Atlanta, Georgia! When I'm not coding,
  I'm just a geek who loves to travel, drink good beer, and watch movies.

  I work full-time as a Lead Software Engineer at Emory University, but also do
  contract work on the side. <a href="/contact">Want to work with me?</a>
