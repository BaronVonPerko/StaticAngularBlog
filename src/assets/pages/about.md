Hey there, I'm Chris Perko.  I'm a web developer currently living in Atlanta, Georgia, with my beautiful wife, two dogs, and a cat.  When I'm not coding, I'm just a geek who loves to travel, drink good beer, and watch movies.

I started this blog to help others with problems that I run into.  I believe that writing what the problem was and how I solved it can maybe make another developer's life easier.

I also plan to start some tutorials on various projects.  I'm currently learning WordPress, Angular2, Laravel, and VueJS.

Check out my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ChrisPerko/) to see some of the other fun stuff I like to play with!
